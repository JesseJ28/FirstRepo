# FirstRepo

I'd like to create a simple game using SDL to create a basis for more advanced games

I think an idle game would be a decent first game

Villiage of people completing jobs
Each has skill levels
 * swordplay
 * archery
 * farm
 * social
 * smithing
 * mining
 * woodcutting
 * fletching

I'm getting into rpg mode already

Just graduated high school of medeval era
You're in a small town with a couple of people (stardew valleyish)
Completely sandbox, you can choose what you want to do
You have a small house, but you could potentially upgrade.
There are a couple of people and 2 females in the first town
You have a variety of skills that dictate what you can do
